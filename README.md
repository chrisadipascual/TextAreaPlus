# TextAreaPlus
Simple textbox with customizable width (in percentage) and rows.
Maybe you have a project that requires multiple textareas, and the client wishes
x rows each.

## This Project is now deprecated with the release of umbraco 8. 
The built in textarea now has maximum characters allowed and number of rows, it is much better and comes in built in for ease.
Thanks for all the kind messages from all platforms. Thank you so much for all the donations. It keeps me going!
